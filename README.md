# RPGMUD

This is the server side of my RPG MUD experiment. Feel free to fork this or make a pull request. 
This project is designed to integrate with any and all clients with signalr. 
I have also created slack and discord bots to interact with the server via signalr. I used signalr to allow for replication of player's actions to other clients.
The eventual goal of this would be to allow users to create text adventures to play together, and to have an MMO style overworld for further exploration, building, and social interaction.
